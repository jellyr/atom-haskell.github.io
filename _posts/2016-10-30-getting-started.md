# What is IDE-Haskell?

IDE-Haskell is a collection of packages for [Atom editor](https://atom.io) that enables Haskell support. It was initially conceived as a response to rather disheartening state of Haskell tooling at the time. It is still very much a work-in-progress, but it already makes Haskell hacking in Atom a much more pleasing experience, for both experienced Haskell hackers and newcomers.

IDE-Haskell uses modular design, so it's possible to use only those features that you care about and never bother with the rest.

Of course, IDE-Haskell is not the only possible option, if you're looking for a tool to help you code in Haskell. Some noteworthy alternatives include:

- [Leksah](http://leksah.org/) -- a Haskell IDE written in Haskell
- [Haskell-mode for Emacs](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-mode) -- Emacs editor support for Haskell
- [ghc-mod Emacs frontend](https://github.com/DanielG/ghc-mod) -- Advanced Haskell features for Emacs
- [SublimeHaskell for SublimeText](https://github.com/SublimeHaskell/SublimeHaskell) -- SublimeText support for Haskell
- [Haskellmode-vim](https://github.com/lukerandall/haskellmode-vim) -- Vim support for Haskell
- [ghcmod-vim](https://github.com/eagletmt/ghcmod-vim) -- Advanced Haskell features for Vim
- Many others

Of course, these alternatives come with their own editors and their own sets of features. Atom strikes a good balance between being approachable and hackable, and IDE-Haskell tries to follow suit.

All of IDE-Haskell sources are released under a MIT license.

# Installation

To install IDE-Haskell, you first need to install Atom. Refer to [Atom Flight Manual](http://flight-manual.atom.io/getting-started/sections/installing-atom/) for that part.
